### Add Blogs to Nav Menu ###

This is a WordPress Plugin that allows you to add blogs to Nav Menus with a simple check and add functionality like WordPress already has for posts and pages


Install
-------

Follow the common Manual Wordpress Plugin Install directions.  I will have this ready for subbmission to wordpress.org soon


1. Download the zip of this repository and extract to a temporary directory
2. Create a folder in your wordpress install under the wp-content/plugins/ folder called `fast-multisite-switching`
3. Upload all the files from the temporary directory to the directory you just made on the wordpress install `wp-content/plugins/fast-multisite-switching` (Your `wp-content/plugins/fast-multisite-switching` folder should have at least 1 php file in it... not just another folder)
